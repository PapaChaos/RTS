## Parser 
Comma separated files from spreadsheets (.csv) can be parsed. Can add other ways to parse later. 
Can add the files in: Assets/Resources/Spreadsheets/ and then set the name in the parser window and it will convert it.

Might add more functionality to the parser later to be used to other projects. But right now it functions for the game.
